'''
Given a list of integers nums, and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers which sum up to the target. Do not use the same list element twice.

Clarifications:

There is at most one solution.
If there is no valid solution, return [-1, -1].
Return the indices in increasing order (i.e. [1,3], NOT [3,1]).
 nums = [1, 4, 6, 10], target = 10
