Given an integer n, generate all simplified fractions between 0 and 1 (exclusive) 
where the denominator is less than or equal to n. A fraction is simplified if the 
numerator and denominator have no common divisors other than 1.

Return a sorted list of fractions, where each fraction is represented as 
[numerator, denominator].
