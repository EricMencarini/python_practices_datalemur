'''
You are given an m x n matrix. Your task is to determine if the matrix 
has diagonal stripes where all elements in each diagonal from top-left to 
bottom-right are of the same stripeâ€”that is, they are identical.

In this context, each diagonal stripe runs from the top-left corner to the 
bottom-right corner of the matrix. Check if every diagonal stripe consists 
entirely of the same number.

Return True if all diagonal stripes are of the same stripe, otherwise return False.
